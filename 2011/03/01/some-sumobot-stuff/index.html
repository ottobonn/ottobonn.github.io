We have a SumoBot team competing in
a Hive13 competition coming up, in Cincinnati. Searching for wheels for a
Mini-class bot, I happened across the 1.25” rubber-tired wheels from Solarbotics
(the <a href="http://www.solarbotics.com/products/rw2i/" title="Solarbotics RW2" target="_blank" rel="external">RW2</a>s). I
like the small diameter and grippy material, but I have their GM8 gearmotors
with double-flat axles. To work both into my design, I decided I would make a 3D
model for a rim that would both fit in those tires and work with the GM8-style
output shaft.</p>
<p>After four iterations, the plastic wheel does what I want. It’s intended for
printing on a MakerBot or similar plastic-enabled printer, specifically in ABS.
I tried PLA and the close tolerances were a bit off, but I’m sure a bit of
variable-tweaking would fix that. I printed mine in black ABS, and they fit the
GM8s just right. I hope these rims are useful to other makers, and I’ve uploaded
<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6748" title="The wheels on Thingiverse" target="_blank" rel="external">the designs</a>
to Thingiverse. See after the break for details.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>The wheel had several design requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fit on the GM-style double-flat axle tab</li>
<li>Fit in the RW2 tires from Solarbotics</li>
<li>Be printable on the MakerBot</li>
</ol>
<p>I designed the wheel in OpenSCAD and compiled and printed it with ReplicatorG.</p>
<p>Measuring the tab came first. It’s 7mm in diameter and 5mm wide between flats,
with a 7mm diameter of curvature on the rounded ends. I made a cylinder of the
same curvature and intersected a rectangular prism of 5mm width with it.</p>
<p>The original wheels are cylinders with three ridges, one on each end and one in
the center. The center ridge is 2mm high by 1mm wide, and the outside ones are
1mm by 1mm. The diameter of the rim without ridges is 17mm, and the wheel width
is 13.2mm. A 2mm-tall center ridge doesn’t print well on the MakerBot, so I
compromised and made the ridge 1.75mm.</p>
<p>The outboard side of the wheel has a conic inset, a shape the MakerBot can print
under the rest of the wheel. The wheel has a screw hole 2mm in diameter for the
GM screws, though it fits quite snugly on its own. =</p>
<p>A flag in the OpenSCAD file disables the tab inset so you can print freewheeling
rims as well.</p>
