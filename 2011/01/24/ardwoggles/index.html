my number of extracurricular projects has gone up as well. At least I can’t say
I’m bored!</p>
<p>In my most recent Arduino hack-together, I decided I would try to bang out some
light-therapy goggles to liven up the gray Winter evenings. I love the emotional
possibilities of light-based projects, and the goggles provide a very personal
connection to the two RGB LEDs they house. In this post I’ll do a brief writeup
of my hour-long prototyping escapade.</p>

<h3 id="The-Super-Simple-Setup"><a href="#The-Super-Simple-Setup" class="headerlink" title="The Super-Simple Setup"></a>The Super-Simple Setup</h3><p>Ardwoggles (my mom came up with that one, and it stuck) are a very simple device
thanks to the all-purpose power of the Arduino board. The starting point was a
pair of safety goggles, which I wrapped in white printer paper. As shown in the
picture, the main attraction is a pair of LEDs, specifically common-cathode
RGBs. To get that just-right diffusion on the inside, I sanded off the top of
each LED until it was flat, and laid three layer of white paper between the
lights and the goggle glass.</p>
<p>Power comes from a wall-wart at the moment, though as soon as I find a battery
pack I’ll strap it on. The wall tether provides an excuse for settling down,
breathing deeply, and enjoying the colorful journey.</p>
<h3 id="The-Therapeutic-Code"><a href="#The-Therapeutic-Code" class="headerlink" title="The Therapeutic Code"></a>The Therapeutic Code</h3><p>Ardwoggles run on a special breed of the code from my StaRGB project, which has
no project page yet. The premise is simple: gently fade between soothing,
hypnotic colors using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation" title="PWM on Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="external">PWM</a>
on the six Arduino-to-LED outputs.</p>
<h3 id="The-Psychedelic-Aftermath"><a href="#The-Psychedelic-Aftermath" class="headerlink" title="The Psychedelic Aftermath"></a>The Psychedelic Aftermath</h3><p>The fun part of the Ardwoggles is the enveloping, immersive world of color they
bring right to your eyes. It’s arguably just as fun to watch others wear the
goggles, both for their expressions and the cyborg-like costume the goggles
create. The goggles are cheap and easy to build, and provide some good, clean
relaxation in the downtime of the day.</p>
