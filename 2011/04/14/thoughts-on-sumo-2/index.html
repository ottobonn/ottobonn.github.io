I have of course discovered several problems in
the design, both in the circuit and the mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="The-Circuit"><a href="#The-Circuit" class="headerlink" title="The Circuit"></a>The Circuit</h3><p>First off, the circuit. In my PCB I had routed some traces that would need
jumpers close to other pins. Rather than jumping the neat way, with a via and a
component-side wire, I decided to surface-mount the jumpers to the trace side of
the board. For next time, I will dedicate some vias for the jumpers, and route
my traces farther apart.</p>

<p>I forgetfully connected Arduino D1 to a green status LED. D1 happens to be the
serial transmit pin, so my green LED would either blink every time I send serial
data, or my controlling the green LED would send spurious serial data. I cut the
trace with a razor knife and jumped it to D8, a free pin that happened to be
physically near the LED.</p>
<p>The battery input jumper is too close to the 7805 regulator, which needed a
heatsink for testing, making it difficult to plug and unplug the power cable and
sensors (also nearby). The general number of jumpers was annoying to deal with
after a long build on the PCB, especially because the jumpers clutter up the
bottom of the otherwise-tidy board.</p>

<h3 id="The-Mechanics"><a href="#The-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="The Mechanics"></a>The Mechanics</h3><p>My robot is front-wheel drive, to avoid tracking issues associated with the
large tolerances in the free wheels. Unfortunately, when the robot pushes
against an object with its front shield, it tends to torque backwards about the
rear wheels. The result is a lift on the front wheels and a loss of traction. My
next bot will have motors in the rear, if not on all fours.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for this round, I will not be able to change the drive layout in
time. The sensors rely on the free space around the front wheels, so running the
robot in reverse will not work. I would need to move the motors to the
rear-wheel slots, and I donâ€™t think there will be room.</p>
