with the results. The lines are clean, the sizes are just to spec, and I got 20
boards instead of the ten I ordered (presumably to account for manufacturing
defects, though I haven’t found any). I populated one of the PCBs, and the
design works!</p>
<h3 id="The-Boards"><a href="#The-Boards" class="headerlink" title="The Boards"></a>The Boards</h3><p>The StarTiny boards turned out just right. Granted, it’s a very simple design.
However, the price was right at just $3 per board. I originally hoped to order
in the US, but the cost was just too high for an entry-level designer trying to
get a feel for the manufacturing process.</p>
<h3 id="The-Code"><a href="#The-Code" class="headerlink" title="The Code"></a>The Code</h3><p>The code I had written for my solderless-breadboard ATtiny was close to correct,
though the timings were a bit off from what I wanted. As I’ve said before,
there’s not enough flash space to include floating-point math libraries, so I
had to forgo the sin() function I used on the Ardweeny. The code uses a
rudimentary linear ramp to approximate the sine, and the results are pretty
good, though there is a bit less visual distinction between the nodes.</p>
<p>I altered the pin mappings in the code to reflect the connections on the PCB,
and I think with a few more tweaks I can get the look just right.</p>
<h3 id="Change-of-Plans-with-Paper"><a href="#Change-of-Plans-with-Paper" class="headerlink" title="Change of Plans with Paper"></a>Change of Plans with Paper</h3><p>The paper doesn’t pass light as well as I had hoped. I could try sourcing
brighter LEDs, but they would have to stay under the 20mA drive capabilities of
the ‘tiny. I think I might go with lighter-colored (and thinner) paper instead.
The issue then would be structural integrity, though.</p>
