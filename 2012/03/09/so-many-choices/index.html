                <p>Last night I had an involved conversation with a peer. I had come back from
class thinking about the state of the global economy, and specifically the
advanced rate of gadget consumption in the U.S. I insisted, as I lately do, that
our obsession with high rates of gadget turnover is both unhealthy for our
environment and for our happiness.</p>
<p>My thinking was largely inspired by the
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html" target="_blank" rel="external">TED talk I had just watched</a>,
about what speaker Barry Schwartz calls “The Paradox of Choice.” His thesis is
that, given some choice over none, people tend to be happier, but at some
critical point the number of choices overwhelms the consumer and people simply
cannot feel happy about their choices.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Today’s consumers have perhaps more choices than ever before, and arguably more
choices in tech than in any other department of goods. Take a look at Lenovo’s
website. I was browsing the latest and greatest in workforce laptops, and I was
greeted by a web page spread wider than my five-year-old laptop’s 1080
horizontal pixels. Scrolling up and down and over and back I saw more laptops
than I could reasonably hold in mind at a time, and worse, I couldn’t discern
the difference between most of them. How do I choose between “SmartBuy” and
“Enhanced Experience” ? How could I know whether a ThinkPad on the lower end of
its price range would serve me better than an IdeaPad outfitted with the more
luxurious options?</p>
<p>It’s not Lenovo’s fault, per se, that their offering are so diverse; nor is this
a problem with Lenovo in particular. Over-diversification is common to basically
every tech company today, and especially those marketed to the US consumers. I
understand that some enterprise managers want very specific options, but
detailed customization of this fine grain is not appropriate on a product home
page. In situations like this one, in which I am trying to evaluate the state of
the tech market, I am tempted to ask the designers and engineers, “Which product
are you proud of? Which one of these options did you work hardest on?”</p>
<p>I suppose that, at the root of it, I want to know that modern designers and
scientists and engineers are driven–like those of yesteryear seemed to be–by
good quality and pride in craftsmanship. Our country needs things that get
better with age. Or, at least, things that don’t obsolete so quickly.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to imply that I oppose technological innovation and progress;
contrarily, I believe that technology is a transformative and potentially
empowering and beneficial element of humanity. I simply think that we need to
shift our mainstream focus from consuming more goods, more quickly, to valuing
what we have.</p>
<p>This kind of shift would benefit hugely from interoperable and modular parts. If
my computer can accept a new processor a few years down the road, I will be more
likely to keep it. I could simply upgrade the components that need upgrading and
keep the rest, which is in all likelihood perfectly functional. Incremental
modifications and upgrades would save consumers money, cause companies to focus
on long-lasting product designs, and ultimately help people live a bit lighter
on the world.</p>
<p>I’m calling on technological collaboration, but also a shift in our social
paradigm. It’s time for everyone to slow down, evaluate our priorities, and
ultimately reduce consumption.</p>
<p>I don’t profess environmental concern as a means of self-valuation or
absolution. I know that many people use “environment” and “green” as words to
throw around in gaining credibility. I truly love and respect the natural world,
and I also believe that environmental safety is directly connected to our
safety. However far people think they can divorce themselves from the
environment, we are all fundamentally connected to our natural
roots.</p>
