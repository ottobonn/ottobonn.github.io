<p>I love the look and feel of vintage analog gauges, like those on the
instrumentation panels of WWII-era planes and submarines. They have a certain
aura of importance and longevity that attracts me. I have been thinking about a
wireless hardware add-on that artfully displays my computer’s temperature and
CPU usage, and I figured that some of those old gauges would be awesome for this
project if I could find them at the right price.</p>
<p>I had actually looked around online for vintage panel meters before, but I was
too specific: I was trying to find DC panel meters for voltages under 12V. I
recently realized that I could instead choose any of the multitude of DC meters
available on eBay, as most of them simply use scaling resistors to calibrate to
the ranges on their faces. So, I ordered two that I thought looked cool, for
around $20 each.</p>
<p>I got the first gauge in the mail today. It’s a “20 mA” DC current meter, with a
metal faceplate, solid glass crystal, and a metal housing. It has two screw
terminals on the back. It’s also waterproof and ruggedized. Of course, I want it
to display CPU temperature and not “DC Milliamperes,” so I immediately started
the teardown.</p>
<h3 id="The-Teardown"><a href="#The-Teardown" class="headerlink" title="The Teardown"></a>The Teardown</h3><p>The gauge has a metal face held on by six small machine screws. Removing these,
along with the three mounting screws, I exposed the crystal.</p>
<p>The crystal lifts off, though it was a bit stuck down due to years of pressure
on the rubber gasket. Prying up gently around the gasket, the crystal easily
peeled off and I was left with the exposed inner gauge.</p>
<p>To get the gauge assembly out I had to remove the screw terminal nuts on the
back of the unit. Then everything slid out of the housing.</p>
<p>The faceplate was held in place by two hex-headed machine screws. Removing
these, I carefully slid the plate out from under the indicator needle. I popped
the plate into the scanner, and it was time for a face lift.</p>
<h3 id="The-Face-Lift"><a href="#The-Face-Lift" class="headerlink" title="The Face Lift"></a>The Face Lift</h3><p>I loved the look of the face that came in the gauge. It just had the wrong label
and units. So, I scanned the plate with a flatbed scanner, then cleaned up all
around the edges with GIMP, my image editor of choice. I also rotated the face
to align it with the program’s grid.</p>
<p>The plate had the word “MILLIAMPERES” across the center, so the first change I
made was replacing this text with “CPU TEMP”. I also changed the smaller “D.C.”
label to “°C”, and masked out all the numerals with background color.</p>
<p>To find the range of values I needed, I installed “Psensor,” a graphing utility
for system vitals monitoring on Ubuntu. Then I opened every application I could,
running multiple browsers with videos and music, etc. I wanted to find the
maximum temperature of the CPU under normal conditions. It peaked around 88º C,
so I decided on 50-100º C for the indicated values on the new faceplate.</p>
<p>Matching fonts as closely as I could, I aligned the new numerals where the old
ones had been. I printed a test page, and fortunately it was exactly the right
size!</p>
<p>I got out some fancy stationery that happened to closely match the color of the
faceplate, and printed my new design on high quality. I cut the design out with
a razor knife, and then carefully applied removable double-sided tape across the
whole plate. I trimmed away the edges of the tape so it would’t show.</p>
<p>Finally, I applied the new face plate design and smoothed it down gently. Time
to reassemble!</p>
<h3 id="The-Reassembly"><a href="#The-Reassembly" class="headerlink" title="The Reassembly"></a>The Reassembly</h3><p>From here the project was simply a matter of working in reverse. The plate when
onto the gauge assembly, and both of its screws went back in.</p>
<p>Then I slid the whole assembly into the housing, and applied the (now clean)
crystal, followed by the outer gasket and metal face.</p>
<p>Around back, the screw terminal accessories went back on, and it was time to try
some electrical experiments.</p>
<h3 id="Calibration"><a href="#Calibration" class="headerlink" title="Calibration"></a>Calibration</h3><p>I wanted to find the full-swing current of the gauge. It was labelled “50mA”,
but it came with resistors attached in parallel to the screw terminals on the
back. I removed the resistors, attaching my multimeter across the gauge
terminal. Its resistance mode measured the gauge at precisely 10 ohms.</p>
<p>Next I hooked the gauge to a 1.3V DC power supply in series with an ammeter and
a 10K potentiometer. Dialing down the resistance, the gauge made a full swing at
almost exactly 5mA. When I am ready to hook it to a microcontroller, there won’t
be a problem sourcing such a small drive current. Awesome!</p>
<h3 id="Files"><a href="#Files" class="headerlink" title="Files"></a>Files</h3><p>In case you want to try your hand at gauge modding, here are the GIMP files I used:
