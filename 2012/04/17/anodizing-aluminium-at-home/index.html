I bought a
12”-square sheet through McMaster-Carr, and after cutting it to size decided it
would be best to anodize the finished product to keep it from scratching or
corroding. After a few successful tests, I ran the final process, though I
switched the anode and cathode polarities by accident, resulting in a strange
thin-film oxidation on the work piece, which gives rise to varied rainbow
interference patterns.</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Etch"><a href="#Step-1-Etch" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Etch"></a>Step 1: Etch</h3><p>After sanding and thoroughly cleaning the Aluminium with detergent (dish soap),
I etched it in a solution of lye (Sodium Hydroxide) to remove surface defects
and give a matte finish, like that of the Apple MacBook. I bought the lye in a
solid form, as crystals of drain cleaner, and assumed that the crystals were
pure lye (a stretch, though it was the best conservative estimate I could make).
I read a guide about the etching process that suggested a 15% lye solution, so I
mixed 1 part lye to 6 parts water in a 5-gallon plastic bucket. Wearing gloves
and goggles, I submerged the metal in the solution, and it heated up and bubbled
furiously as the lye ate away the surface. I only left the piece in solution
about 2 minutes, to give a consistent matte look without making pock marks.</p>
<h3 id="Step-2-Desmut"><a href="#Step-2-Desmut" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Desmut"></a>Step 2: Desmut</h3><p>I don’t have access to proper desmut solution, the solvent that takes off the
impure “smut” residue that accumulates on the surface of treated Aluminium. I
rinsed the part in water and cleaned it with dish soap to fair success, and
proceeded to anodizing.</p>
<h3 id="Step-3-Anodize"><a href="#Step-3-Anodize" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Anodize"></a>Step 3: Anodize</h3><p>Well, this step is supposed to involve using the work piece as an anode
(positive terminal) in a direct-current circuit. The theory is that the metal
will form a thin oxide layer, a clear ceramic that adds scratch- and
corrosion-resistance to the finish. However, I accidentally wired the system in
reverse, so that the work piece was the cathode (negative terminal). The result
was a strange thin film of oxide that creates rainbow interference patterns. I
like the look, and I assume the coating is indeed Aluminium oxide as it should
be, but I cannot know for sure. It seems to have moderate scratch resistance,
but I may try again with the correct circuit some time in the future to get it
right. In the mean time, I am enjoying the vintage effect the “cathodizing”
created, and I may just decide to keep it this way.</p>
<p>Following the guide I found, I bought battery acid from the local auto parts
store and mixed it into water in the ratio of 1 parts acid to 4 parts water. The
acid comes as 50% solution, and the goal is to have around 10%, so a solution of
about 12% acid is just about right. The solution stays at room temperature.</p>
<p>I fashioned an electrode (supposedly a cathode, though due to my error
ultimately an anode) out of Aluminium stock, which I placed in the bottom of the
bucket of acid solution. I used an old computer ATX power supply to run a
current of around 16 Amps through the workpiece, dangling from a bar of
Aluminium, into the acid solution and back out through the “cathode”. Because I
had wired the whole thing in reverse, the intended “cathode” ended up with the
MacBook-like finish while my part looked just about the same as it did going in.</p>
<p>I sealed the part with boiling water for about an hour, and the rainbow effects
showed up. Not exactly what I was after, but cool!</p>
