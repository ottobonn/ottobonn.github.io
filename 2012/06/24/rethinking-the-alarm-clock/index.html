It wakes me up in the morning, and
because I get up at different times each day depending on what I need to do, I
end up setting the alarm time again almost every night. I have been thinking
about device design and the user experience of an alarm clock, and I have some
idea that may make it into a new prototype I’m building. The device I have in
mind isn’t really cost-effective–It won’t compete with the bargain-basement
plastic clocks pouring out of China–but I would like to explore some new design
ideas.</p>
<h2 id="Problems-with-Other-Clocks"><a href="#Problems-with-Other-Clocks" class="headerlink" title="Problems with Other Clocks"></a>Problems with Other Clocks</h2><p>The clock I use every day is bare-bones. I like it, because it has multi-colored
seven-segment displays. But the interface for setting and checking the time and
alarm settings is the seemingly-standard four buttons: time and alarm buttons;
and hour and minute buttons.</p>
<p>The interface is admirably simple, driven to extremes by the competition for
lower prices. But it requires two hands to use, and to setting a time earlier
than the one programmed in the clock is annoying. There is no way to go back;
the user must go “around the horn” to choose a new time. Simply holding the
buttons down doesn’t work, either: the clock counts forward so slowly that my
finger cramps from holding the button for so long. So I end up pressing the
buttons as quickly as I can, and if I miss the minute I need, it’s another fifty
nine clicks to get back around. That’s annoying!</p>
<p>I also generally find myself frustrated with the lack of clarity as to whether
the alarm is even active. The designers usually hide the alarm switch on the
side or back of the clock, so if you don’t want to snooze, you’ll have to flip
the flimsy switch until the evening.</p>
<h2 id="My-Goals"><a href="#My-Goals" class="headerlink" title="My Goals"></a>My Goals</h2><p>I would like to create the simplest and fastest interface I can. I have many
thoughts about how to do so, but some ideas are central. Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choosing a time is a continuous action. Time (at least as clocks portray it)
is linear, and the user needs to be able to find a time in the continuum quickly
and easily. For this task, I have in mind a rotary encoder, like a modern volume
knob. The detents should be gentle and smooth, and fairly close together so
going through sixty click doesn’t take too much effort.</li>
<li>Clocks are important at night, so the screen needs to light up. I don’t want
to press anything to see what time it is, and I surely don’t want to turn on a
lamp to see the time. I want to know, still in the dark, whether the alarm is
on, what time it is now, and whether the clock thinks it is currently morning or
night.</li>
<li>The clock needs to survive a small power outage. If I have just fallen
asleep, a power outage is not going to wake me up. And if the clock doesn’t wake
me, nothing will. So I need the clock to remember the time for about twelve
hours when it’s off wall power, and still sound the alarm when I have to get up.
It doesn’t have to show the time if that takes too much energy, but it does have
to wake me up.</li>
<li>The alarm switch and buttons need to feel good. I want a solid click, not a
wimpy squish.</li>
<li>The clock needs to look nice. Ugly appliances are garbage.</li>
</ol>
