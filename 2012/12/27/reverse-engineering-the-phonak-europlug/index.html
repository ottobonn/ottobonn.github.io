listen to music deteriorated so far that only one channel was working.
Unfortunately, the cables are $50 new and hard to buy. I decided to try my hand
at making a new cable, using top-quality components.</p>
<h2 id="The-Old-Cable"><a href="#The-Old-Cable" class="headerlink" title="The Old Cable"></a>The Old Cable</h2><p>In my haste, I didn’t photograph the old cable. It was a blue PVC patch cable
with a Y-splitter about halfway up, like many earbud cables. The splitter was
suspiciously large, a fact that will be important later in this tale. I started
by measuring for continuity from the TRS (tip-ring-shaft) connector to the
“Europlug” connectors at the hearing aids. It seemed that the cable was
completely broken, since no current would flow except in the ground return!</p>
<p>I thought the discontinuity might be somewhere in the cheap cabling along the
way, so I cut the Europlugs off (leaving whips for soldering later) and found
that the connectors were intact.</p>

<p>I next checked the TRS end of the cable, and it too seemed okay. The only reason
that the cable would not conduct, then, is if it had some sort of AC coupling
capacitors for attenuation… I carefully cut away the cast silicone on the
larger-than-normal Y splitter and indeed found an attenuator circuit inside. It
was formed on a tiny two-sided PCB, but a little trace-following revealed the
schematic:</p>

<p>The attenuator turns out to be very important. Without it, headphone audio
signals commonly reach up to 2Vpp (peak-to-peak). On the other hand, the
low-voltage battery in the hearing aid sets its maximum allowable voltage to
around 1.3V. Considering that the ‘aid can function even when the battery is
low, and can receive signals from tiny accessory “boots” that act as parasites
on the main battery, it makes sense that the signal level can be very tiny. The
attenuator in the cable bring the headphone signal down to the order of
millivolts, protecting the hearing aid from overvoltage. Without it, even the
lowest volume settings would sound horribly loud!</p>
<p>I used the schematic I harvested and the old connectors to build a new, better
cable with fancy braided insulation for durability.</p>

<h2 id="Files"><a href="#Files" class="headerlink" title="Files"></a>Files</h2><p>I made a <a href="/uploads/2012/12/Attenuator.sch_.zip">gEDA schematic</a> of the
attenuator and connectors, in case anyone needs it. Hack on!</p>
