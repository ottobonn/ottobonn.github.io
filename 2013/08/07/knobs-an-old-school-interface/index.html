<p>I love thinking about and designing computer interfaces, in code and in the
physical world. And I really love knobs, specifically infinite-scrolling with
rotary encoders.</p>
<p>Pursuant to my love of interfaces and knobs, I put together a three-knob
interface for my laptop, and I call it “Knobs.”</p>
<h2 id="Why-knobs"><a href="#Why-knobs" class="headerlink" title="Why knobs?"></a>Why knobs?</h2><p>I was thinking about the touch-based inputs we use so often now. I really like
touch screens, but they miss out on some of the haptic satisfaction of bulkier,
older-style interfaces. I love old Hi-Fi audio equipment, because of its sense
of purpose and ease of operation. I wanted to experiment with a heavier, more
tangible interface for my computer.</p>
<p>Knobs are cool because they can represent any linearly variable quantity, like
volume, brightness, intensity, or tone. Thy can also represent position, speed,
or menu choices. I built this project to be as open-ended as possible, because I
didn’t really know what I would use it for.</p>
<h2 id="Functionality"><a href="#Functionality" class="headerlink" title="Functionality"></a>Functionality</h2><p>I currently have the knobs controlling my window manager. One emulates alt +
tab, for switching between open windows, and one emulates ctrl + alt + arrow,
for switching between workspaces. I haven’t decided what the third should do,
and I haven’t yet used the shaft button for anything.</p>
<h2 id="Technical-implementation"><a href="#Technical-implementation" class="headerlink" title="Technical implementation"></a>Technical implementation</h2><p>Knobs is really simple: an Arduino Pro Micro knockoff is wired to three rotary
encoders. It doesn’t have enough interrupts to watch all three, so instead it
polls each encoder as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The Arduino has a built-in USB stack, so it emulates a keyboard. It sends
keypresses when the encoders move, and those are mapped to window-manager
controls on my laptop.</p>
<p>The source code, for Arduino 1.0 or higher,
<a href="https://github.com/ottobonn/Knobs" title="Knobs on GitHub" target="_blank" rel="external">is on my GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Physical-Design"><a href="#Physical-Design" class="headerlink" title="Physical Design"></a>Physical Design</h2><p>Most of the project as focused on the form factor of a human-computer knob
interface. I decided three knobs would be useful without being too bulky. I
wanted a feeling of high quality and solidity, with intuitive purpose.</p>
<img src="/uploads/2013/08/body-CAM00672.jpg" alt="Knobs without the, erm, knobs.">
<p>The knobs invite the user to interact with them. They aren’t labelled, but their
effects are immediate and reversible, so experimenting with them is natural. The
enclosure is a solid block of black walnut, hollowed with a drill press and
oiled with Tung oil. The two end faces are quarter-inch Aluminium plate, sanded,
brushed, etched and then anodized. Four black hex-head bolts hold each plate on
at its corners, and are easy to remove thanks to the embedded metal threads in
the wood.</p>
<p>A single USB port is the only output on the rear plate, and the device has no
lights, other sensors, or batteries. It is as simple as possible, while being as
useful as three knobs can be.</p>
<h2 id="Influences"><a href="#Influences" class="headerlink" title="Influences"></a>Influences</h2><p>Knobs was heavily inspired by Hi-Fi equipment. I also channelled the aesthetic
of <a href="http://monome.org/" title="Monome" target="_blank" rel="external">Monome</a>, a new interface group legendary in the
music community. I wanted the purposeful feeling of an oscilloscope, where each
important function is broken-out to a top-level control, in the form of a
physical sensor like a switch or knob.</p>
<p>I like the idea of important functions being on the top level of interaction:
the user doesn’t have to dig for them. The knobs don’t have any modifier keys to
change their functions, like a shift or alt key does for a keyboard. They don’t
do different things based on the context of work on the computer; instead, they
have a “global” scope.</p>
<p>The knobs take up space. They are always present on the desk, which could be
good or bad, depending on how you look at it. On the one hand, they are never
hidden, so they are always easy to find and use right away. When I want to
switch workspaces, I turn the workspace knob. On the other hand, they take up
valuable space to do something I can do with my keyboard. They are heavy and
don’t travel well. Maybe that, too, is part of why I like them.</p>
<p>Aluminium and wood are two of my favorite materials in the world, and I love
combining them. A computer interface device is an unexpected candidate for these
architectural materials, and I think they bring a sense of humanism and
physicality to virtual spaces. They wear well and last a lifetime, and they feel
good to hold and manipulate. The knobs feel cool to the touch after they sit
unused for a few minutes, then they warm up as they are used more often. The
walnut is smooth and warm to the touch, and its natural grain pattern
complements the precision of the Aluminium.</p>
<h2 id="Utility"><a href="#Utility" class="headerlink" title="Utility"></a>Utility</h2><p>The Knobs aren’t all that useful to me right now, but I like them and I am glad
I made them. I learned how to interface with rotary encoders–it’s actually
quite simple.</p>
<p>Reflecting more on the action of switching between running tasks with the
keyboard (for example using alt + tab), I realized that the main point of the
shortcut was to keep both hands on the keyboard. Reaching for a knob is just as
time-consuming as reaching to a mouse or touchpad, but the cognitive load of
turning a purpose-built knobs is lower than that of locating, moving to, and
clicking on a task-tray representation of an application.</p>
<p>The knobs don’t really save any motion, so maybe foot pedals would be better for
the ultimate in efficiency. Knobs are very intuitive, though, and they can
easily map to media controls, or perhaps the zoom level of a browser window. In
theory, they could map to any function of the computer, including those
affecting the web. I just need to think some more about what those functions
might be.</p>
