                <p>New instant answer services like Siri and Google now are awesome. They let
curious but otherwise busy people look up that random fact. They let people on
the road communicate safely. And perhaps the most significantly a present
complicated information in the form of a single answer usually larger than the
related search results to make digesting the information easier.</p>
<p>However, I think that single answer format also poses something of an ethical
dilemma. Or, at least an information security concern.</p>
<p>Think about it: as more and more people start using services like Siri and
Google now and the inevitable clones that will follow, more and more people will
rely on these single phrase answers for their research and day-to-day
information. That in itself is not a problem, but with the scale comes the
emergent effect of a homogeneity of knowledge. If we trust a given service to
decide what the most valuable answer to our questions is, or to decide which
answer we intended to receive, we implicitly agree that the service’s priorities
are also our own priorities.</p>
<p>Of course, the counter-argument would be that the kinds of questions people ask
of services like Siri and Google Now are trivial and usually have factual
answers, such as what time a bus leaves, or what the weather is doing. But to
that I would say that it seems inevitable with new tech like knowledge graphs
and bigger Big Data that the language recognition and the corresponding answers
will only get more nuanced.</p>
<p>When you ask Google a question, you are doing something distinctly different
from searching for related articles or videos or the like. You are combining
“I’m feeling lucky” with a summary algorithm, a cross-referencer, and maybe even
a translator. Of course I don’t know how exactly the algorithms work, but for
once that isn’t my main concern.  The algorithmic answers we trust from these
machines are only as good as the data they mine. When you ask a question, who
exactly is on the other end? Added to the already-difficult problem of
authorship verification online is now the total lack of a source citation on the
one-liner we receive for our query. How do you trust an author you can’t see?
You trust the algorithm that chose to draw from that (or those) author(s).</p>
<p>This averaging effect on the underlying data corpus from which the algorithm
draws its answers leads to the possibility of manipulating the answers people
rely on. If people aren’t doing the careful research themselves, it may be less
obvious if malicious data is injected in order to purposely skew certain
answers.</p>
<p>And, if in the usual case, the answers we get from the instant services are
accurate–for example, for weather information, or for stock quotes–what reason
would we have to distrust the more complicated or sensitive information? I would
say that it is unlikely that the average user will be investigating and
verifying the answers that the service provides.</p>
<p>One-liner questions and answers inadvertently open the door to a sort of
hive-mind effect where the information people use on a daily basis is
cross-linked to the prevailing buzz on the net and extremely condensed and
normalized. However, I think the less-often-discussed side of this new system is
the potential for malicious actors to subtly affect the information people use
on a daily basis, or for potential monied interests to skew common knowledge in
a certain direction. For example, if I ask what is the best refrigerator? And
Google now on replies a Frigidaire, rather than getting the results page of
various tech reviews I will get a single answer. How will I know the origin of
the answer? If many people rely on this form of research, the common perception
will come to depend on the service provider’s choice of ad influence,
statistical weights, and so on.</p>
<p>These services are certainly helpful for quick information, but please don’t
sacrifice your willingness too dig a little deeper for things that matter.</p>
