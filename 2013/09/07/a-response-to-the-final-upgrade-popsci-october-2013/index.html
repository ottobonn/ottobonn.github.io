Upgrade,” supposedly our way out of phone and PC upgrades by way of smarter
software. What I thought was going to be an insightful look into new
load-minimizing techniques or ultra-efficient consumer software instead quickly
degenerated into the trite “the cloud will save us all” argument.</p>
<p>Ioizzio argues that the end of hardware upgrades is upon us, because obviously
we are offloading more and more processing demands onto the cloud. She made the
comparison to 80s mainframes for me: modern hardware will be “thin client
terminals” for use to log into some corporate mainframe. We will stream video
games (remember the hype for OnLive?), use cloud document editors, etc. But
further, we will log in via some VNC-style remote desktop to a complete
computer-that-doesn’t-belong-to-us. If that’s the future, count me out.</p>
<p>First, the technical problems are not fixed. Americans severely lack the
bandwidth necessary to stream videos satisfactorily, let alone send video game
inputs up and bring graphics back down with sufficiently low latency to make a
game feel good. It just isn’t the same as having a local powerhouse to serve
those graphics over a single meter of copper. But let’s assume, for the sake of
argument, that we’re talking about some awesome fiber-to-the-home future, which
seems imminent. We have tons of bandwidth, and we can stream and upload without
hassle.</p>
<p>The main problem I have with Iozzio’s argument is that it is precisely a
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html" target="_blank" rel="external">service as a software substitute</a>
(SaaSS).
And, as the GNU foundation so thoroughly lays out, SaaSS erodes user
freedom. The cloud-VNC future of non-hardware that Iozzio describes is one step
beyond the current use of cloud storage and documents. It is a whole operating
system on someone else’s computer! As legal teams around the world have already
learned, users have no reasonable expectation of privacy when they use someone
else’s computer. This astonishingly overlooked point means that, in the future
the author envisions, users will never have an expectation of privacy. Ever.
Period.</p>
<p>With our clearer knowledge of the espionage activities of the government, and
even with our old-fashioned common sense, this vision of the future is
unreasonable. It is unacceptable and irresponsible to make a technological
prediction without considering legal and social implications.</p>
<p>So instead of this cloud-VNC nightmare, we should be hosting our own clouds, or
keeping our data locally on our devices, and using better software that works on
older hardware. Users must own the means of computation, or we’ll be right back
where we started, with corporate-mandated policies on what is acceptable for
people to do on their computers. Further, we’ll be begging the NSA to to take a
close look at our whole computing stack, taking whatever they please. Let’s not
go backward after so much progress towards user empowerment.</p>
